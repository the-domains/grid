* Paul Audia - his photography is showcased on our site and we are grateful for his contribution. You can find more of his work on his [site][4].
* Jeffrey Woods - his photography is also showcased on our site and we are grateful for his contribution. You can find more of his work on his [site][5]. 

## Referrals

### How do referral rewards work?

We offer rewards for referring new paid Founding Members. Every Founding Member is provided with a unique referral link that we use to track people who have signed up through referrals.

When you purchase a Grid Founding Membership, we'll give you a unique referral URL to share with your friends. For every person who purchases a Grid Founding Membership using your referral URL **you'll receive $32** of the proceeds refunded toward your order, until your Founding Membership has been paid for. That means if you get three friends to purchase, you'll get your membership free.

Each time someone purchases a Grid Founding Membership using your link, we will send you an email confirming your credit of $32\. Referrals are processed 30 days after purchase.

More specifics:

* Referral credits are attributed to the first person to make the referral. In other words, if your friend Jane has already clicked on a referral link from your friend Joe, Joe will get the credit, not you. It pays to be first.
* If for any reason we don't collect payment from a person that you've referred, your credit will be reversed.
* Referral credits only apply to paid accounts during the pre-order period.

## Grid Tokens

### What are Grid Tokens?

Grid Tokens are NFC encoded tokens (PVC Square Card - NTAG203 - 35 x 35 mm) that we'll be shipping to Founding Members as a reward for early support. Grid Tokens allow you to easily share your site with others by tapping your token against any NFC-enabled device. We'll follow-up with an email survey to collect your physical address as soon as we can.

## Platform Tools

### What are The Grid's platform developer tools?

We've taken a "platform first" approach and for the past few years have launched the technologies that will ultimately culminate in The Grid. By solving some of the web's most vexing technical problems with rare gems of computer science, we're committed to helping designers and developers make the web more beautiful and prosperous.

[Grid Style Sheets][6] - GSS reimagines CSS layout and replaces the browser's layout engine with one that harnesses the Cassowary Constraint Solver - the same algorithm Apple uses to compute native layout.

[Flowhub][7] - Peer-to-peer full-stack visual programming for your fingers. Funded by the 5th most successful Kickstarter during its time in the software category.

### Does The Grid have an API?

Yes, details coming soon. If you want to build something awesome get in touch.
