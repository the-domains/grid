# Website, Meet Your Followers

## Newsletter signups? What a hassle. The Grid allows people to follow your whole website, allowing you to dynamically construct updates when you make changes.

But it doesn't end there. The Grid can track changes on any website, allowing you to follow the entire Internet.
