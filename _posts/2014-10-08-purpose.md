  than stars in our galaxy. There is a stream of enhancements planned. We’ll
  soon release a new version of Design Systems we’re using internally that build

# The Grid for Everyone

## From beta to global release 

Thanks to our _very_ faithful founding members who've helped us battle test the system with more than 50,000 created sites, we're proud to release our adolescent AI to the world. She's young, quirky but all heart. Looking back 3 months from now she will have searched & prodded through more site designs than stars in our galaxy. There is a stream of enhancements planned. We'll soon release a new version of Design Systems we're using internally that build thegrid.io.
