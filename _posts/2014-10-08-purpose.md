# Websites That Evolve With Purpose

## Automated A/B Testing

More followers, more sales, more clicks. All websites are created with a purpose in mind, but it's easy to lose sight of it as you go from brain to domain name. With The Grid, you can set a purpose for your site, write a call to action and sit back. Our AI will automatically test thousands of subtle variations to find the one that works best.

It doesn't end there. As we improve the AI, your site will continually evolve in subtle ways to better achieve the goals you set.
