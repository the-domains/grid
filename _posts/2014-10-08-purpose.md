## From beta to public release (& almost stable ðŸ˜…)

This site was designed by her & after our very faithful founding members helped battle test her with more than 60,000 created sites, we're proud to release our adolescent AI to the world. She's young, quirky but all heart. Looking back 3 months from now she will have searched & prodded through more site designs than stars in our galaxy. Couple years from now, and our buggy little baby will... You'll just have to find out.
