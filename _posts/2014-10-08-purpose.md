  This site was thrown together in v2 & after our very faithful founding members
  helped us battle test the system with more than 100,000 created sites, weâ€™re
  proud to release our adolescent AI to the world. Sheâ€™s young, quirky but all
  heart. Looking back 3 months from now she will have searched & prodded through
  more site design than stars in our galaxy. Couple years from now, and our
  buggy little baby willâ€¦ Youâ€™ll just have to find out.

This site was thrown together in v2 & after our _very_ faithful founding members helped us battle test the system with more than 100,000 created sites, we're proud to release our adolescent AI to the world.

Couple years from now, and our buggy little baby will... You'll just have to find out.
