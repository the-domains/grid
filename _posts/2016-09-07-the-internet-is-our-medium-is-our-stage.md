# The Internet is our medium is our stage

> "An individual can put up a website, if they put enough work into, looks just as impressive as the largest company in the world... It's a very profound thing and a very good thing." - Steve Jobs

The Internet is our medium is our stage. Nothing is that doesn't act, it is the website that describes a scratch but not the itch.

Beware the not-ill-intended inquisition, "do consumers need websites?". Other than rhetorical setup for distinction delivery, it is self-preserving prejudice that lords over questions like "do consumers need music?" or "do people need books?". After-all, why would anyone need their own website when they're so busy building someone else's -\> back to the clicking fields they belong, serving the interests of those with the means for electric existence. By seizing on the total awareness of a medium, the message forms clear.

Perhaps the most obvious "closure" or psychic consequence of any new technology is the pure & immediate demand for it. Nobody wants a car till there are car, and nobody is interested in TV until there are TV programs. This power of technology to create its own world of demand can be attributed to technology being first an extension of our own bodies & senses. When we are deprived of our sense of sight, the other senses take up the role of sight in some degree. But the need to use the senses that are available is as insistent as breathing --- a fact that makes sense of the mythic insatiability of Google searches and Facebook likes.

Electric technology is directly related to our central nervous systems, so it is ridiculous to talk of "what the consumer" played over its own nerves. This question would be like asking people what sort of sights and sounds they would prefer around them in an urban metropolis!

As long as we adopt the Narcissus attitude of regarding the extensions of our own bodies as really out there and really independent of us, we will meet all technological challenges with the same sort of banana-skin pirouette and collapse under nonsensical yet very palatable corporate bullshit.

Archimedes once said, "Give me a place to stand and I will move the world." Today he would have pointed to our electric media and said, "I will stand on your eyes, your ears, your nerves, and your brain, and the world will move in any tempo or pattern I choose."

Just before an airplane breaks the sound barrier, sound waves become visible on the wings of the plane. The sudden visibility of sound just as sound ends is an apt instance of that great pattern of being that reveals new and opposite forms just as the earlier forms reach their peak performance. Online media has never been so vividly fragmented & uniform as in the birth of the Grid, a flash of the next wave to come, a transition from the limits of the age of uniformly branded expression to a new age of mass individualization.

People are growing tired of the sameness of things. Automatic & immediate personalization, once in firm & place, will be an extension of self as fundamental as individuality. Industries will be up-ended like the unwrinkling of the garments as man fills out his new powers of instant & intimate expression.
