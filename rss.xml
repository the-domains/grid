            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Websites That Evolve With Purpose</h1><p>More followers, more sales, more clicks. All websites are created with a purpose in mind, but it's easy to lose sight of it as you go from brain to domain name. With The Grid, you can set a purpose for your site, write a call to action and sit back. Our AI will automatically test thousands of subtle variations to find the one that works best.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cdn.thegrid.io/posts/purposes-chromeless.png"></article>]]></description>
